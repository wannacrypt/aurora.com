A Web project to help farmers ensure greater profitability through direct farmer to supplier and farmer to farmer communication. This service boosts business communication and brings transparency in the system. This innovative site allows for good farmer, retailer and supplier communication. It allows farmers to login and communicate to respective dealers. When dealers publish an advertisement or offer, the respective farmers get notified via Sms message. The farmers may also submit their greviences and complaints to respective dealers or authorities using their farmer login on a separate complaints page and authorities will get acess to that page regularly using their login id and passwords.
